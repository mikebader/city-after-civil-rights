  abstract = {According to recent research, ethnoracial diversity negatively affects trust and social capital. This article challenges the current conception and measurement of ``diversity'' and invites scholars to rethink ``social capital'' in complex societies. It reproduces the analysis of Putnam and shows that the association between diversity and self-reported trust is a compositional artifact attributable to residential sorting: nonwhites report lower trust and are overrepresented in heterogeneous communities. The association between diversity and trust is better explained by differences between communities and their residents in terms of race/ethnicity, residential stability, and economic conditions; these classic indicators of inequality, not diversity, strongly and consistently predict self-reported trust. Diversity indexes also obscure the distinction between in-group and out-group contact. For whites, heterogeneity means more out-group neighbors; for nonwhites, heterogeneity means more in-group neighbors. Therefore, separate analyses were conducted by ethnoracial groups. Only for whites does living among out-group members\textemdash not in diverse communities per se\textemdash negatively predict trust.},

  abstract = {White flight alone does not explain why whites leave integrated neighborhoods. Whites also leave neighborhoods when they die. Current studies ignore deaths (and births) and mistakenly attribute the all population losses to flight. To separate population changes due to natural causes from those due to moves, I decomposed white population changes among 33,862 neighborhoods that lost whites from 2000 to 2010. I found that overlooking births and deaths leads studies to underestimate flight from the most racially diverse neighborhoods and to overestimate flight from biracial neighborhoods. I further found that flight occurs most often among white adults in their twenties and thirties while older whites tend to age in place, a process that keeps older whites living among racially diverse, but younger, neighbors. I offer a theory of inertial integration that reconsiders relative importance of aging and flight among integrated neighborhoods in contemporary America that portends potentially serious social and political consequences.}

  abstract = {Multiracial neighborhood integration has become more common in US metropolitan areas over the past three decades. Traditional theories of racial change predict low levels of satisfaction in these neighborhoods while newer studies question that prediction. This article takes up the question: are residents satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods? The article uses data representing all residents of multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, DC area to study neighborhood satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. The analysis finds evidence of *shared satisfaction* among residents regardless of race: large and *equal* shares of each racial group were satisfied. White residents were less satisfied than white residents of neighborhoods elsewhere in the metropolitan region, but were unlikely to perceive neighborhood decline. The shared satisfaction among residents of all races and the lack of racial antipathy to change among white residents suggests that multiracial neighborhoods offer sites to promote racial equity.}

Existing research overlooks how social networks develop among people at similar points in the life course through repeated interactions in neighborhoods. Existing studies do not illuminate the ways in which these geographically based networks can influence life-altering decisions. In this article, we use qualitative interviews with White, middle-class parents in gentrifying neighborhoods in a large Northeastern city to examine how parents decided where to send their children to kindergarten. Parents reported relying heavily on information that they received from their network of other neighborhood parents whom they had befriended on the playground or at daycare in the course of their daily child-rearing routines. The daily routines of child rearing led to rich and important social networks. But tensions also emerged among parents as they made different decisions about where to send their children to kindergarten. By focusing on how life course stages affect how people use space and interact in neighborhood spaces, we can better understand how neighborhood spaces shape the decision-making process of school choice.},

However, with opportunities to opt out of the zoned public school system, the social and economic contexts of neighborhoods may affect the demographic link between neighborhoods and their public neighborhood schools. Using spatial data on school attendance zones, we estimate the associations between the racial composition of elementary schools and their local neighborhoods, and we investigate how neighborhood factors shape the loose or tight demographic coupling of these parallel social contexts. The results show that greater social distance among residents within neighborhoods, as well as the availability of educational exit options, results in neighborhood public schools that are less reflective of their surrounding communities. In addition, we show that suburban schools are more demographically similar to their neighborhood attendance zones than are urban schools.},

One potential reason behind this is that the share of elderly in a community is endogenous, and it is very difficult to disentangle the effects of individuals aging in place from that of dynamic Tiebout sorting. The point of this paper is to carefully document the degree to which aging in place has occurred in the American suburbs, and to estimate the degree to which it has influenced school finance once the initial settlers of these suburbs were no longer the parents of school-aged children. We hand-match data from the 1950 and 1960 Censuses of Population and Housing to more recent data to link postwar suburban development to later school finance. Using a novel method for identifying the causal effects of aging in place, we find that the percentage of elderly adults in a school district is negatively related to the level of support for public schooling, and that this is particularly true for school districts in metropolitan areas where the school-aged population is more heavily nonwhite relative to the elderly population.},

Where the city's most infamous open-air drug market once stood, a farmers' market now sells grass-fed beef and homemade duck egg ravioli. On the corner where AM.PM carryout used to dish out soul food, a new establishment markets its \$28 foie gras burger. Shaw is experiencing a dramatic transformation, from ``ghetto'' to ``gilded ghetto,'' where white newcomers are rehabbing homes, developing dog parks, and paving the way for a third wave coffee shop on nearly every block. Race, Class, and Politics in the Cappuccino City is an in-depth ethnography of this gilded ghetto. Derek S. Hyra captures here a quickly gentrifying space in which long-time black residents are joined, and variously displaced, by an influx of young, white, relatively wealthy, and/or gay professionals who, in part as a result of global economic forces and the recent development of central business districts, have returned to the cities earlier generations fled decades ago. As a result, America is witnessing the emergence of what Hyra calls ``cappuccino cities.'' A cappuccino has essentially the same ingredients as a cup of coffee with milk, but is considered upscale, and is double the price. In Hyra's cappuccino city, the black inner-city neighborhood undergoes enormous transformations and becomes racially ``lighter'' and more expensive by the year.},

Using both simulated and real data, we show that our approach provides stronger protection against common classification errors and behaves more consistently across a broad range of neighborhood types. We conclude with a substantive application that demonstrates the utility of our multicomponent approach to researchers who are interested in assessing the ``buffering hypothesis.'' We find that our multicomponent approach detects higher levels of WF than recognized in previous studies, raising important questions about the formation and long-term stability of racially diverse neighborhoods in the United States.},

Despite the glowing opportunities that many families associate with suburban schooling, accessing a district's resources is not always straightforward, particularly for black and poorer families. Moving beyond class- and race-based explanations, Inequality in the Promised Land focuses on the everyday interactions between parents, students, teachers, and school administrators in order to understand why resources seldom trickle down to a district's racial and economic minorities. Rolling Acres Public Schools (RAPS) is one of the many well-appointed suburban school districts across the United States that has become increasingly racially and economically diverse over the last forty years. Expanding on Charles Tilly's model of relational analysis and drawing on 100 in-depth interviews as well participant observation and archival research, R. L'Heureux Lewis-McCoy examines the pathways of resources in RAPS. He discovers that\rule{1em}{1pt}due to structural factors, social and class positions, and past experiences\rule{1em}{1pt}resources are not valued equally among families and, even when deemed valuable, financial factors and issues of opportunity hoarding often prevent certain RAPS families from accessing that resource.

They challenged the commitment to growth, boosterism, and the city efficient held by former civic administrations, presenting in its place a program of apparently humane, socially progressive, and aesthetic urban development. Despite some significant successes, the new ideology was also elitist and has generated new problems of social justice, giving rise to a countervailing political movement in the late 1970s.

Nevertheless, the theoretical frameworks we have for describing residential settlement patterns generally treat diversity as an unstable and transitory period that is the product of a unidirectional pressure towards segregation. In our analysis of six diverse neighborhoods in Southeast Seattle, we find evidence of processes at multiple scales that not only maintain diversity, but actually reinforce it. From individual decisions about property ownership to broader patterns of regional disinvestment, we find empirical evidence that indicates a need for a more complex theorization of the processes that create and sustain diverse neighborhoods. In our preliminary theorization of these conditions, we call for a conceptualization of residential settlement patterns that is explicitly multiscalar and recognizes a wider range of cultural, economic, and political relations as central to the production of observed patterns of neighborhood settlement.},

  abstract = {Poverty in the United States has found a new home: the suburbs. Beginning in the year 2000, for the first time in American history, the total number of poor people living in the suburbs exceeded those living in central cities in the 95 largest metropolitan areas. This growth has since continued. More than two-thirds of the increase in poverty in major metropolitan areas has taken place in their suburbs. By 2012 the suburbs accounted for 56 percent of the poor population in these metropolitan areas, exceeding the number of urban poor by 3.5 million. Comparable numbers of urban and suburban persons now live in extreme poverty. Importantly, the rise of suburban poverty has not corresponded with decreases in urban poverty. Poverty rates continue to remain higher in central cities and rural areas than in suburbs. Nevertheless, suburbs in metropolitan areas across the United States are now faced with challenges once thought to be distinctly urban: poverty, joblessness, and decline. In this article, we draw on some of the most recent research of scholars working in this field to better define suburban poverty, describe its trends, and outline several consequences for suburban safety nets. We then conclude with a brief discussion of implications for research and policy.},

In the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits. In the short run, however, immigration and ethnic diversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital. New evidence from the US suggests that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods residents of all races tend to `hunker down'. Trust (even of one's own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer. In the long run, however, successful immigrant societies have overcome such fragmentation by creating new, cross-cutting forms of social solidarity and more encompassing identities. Illustrations of becoming comfortable with diversity are drawn from the US military, religious institutions, and earlier waves of American immigration.},

The revolt has come via an unexpected source: the ballot-box, in a wave of political populism with strong territorial, rather than social foundations. I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem. Place-sensitive development policies need, however, to stay clear of the welfare, income support and big investment projects of past development strategies if they are to be successful and focus on tapping into untapped potential and on providing opportunities to those people living in the places that ``don't matter''.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I make a critical assessment of the ways that issues relating to the 'gentrification' of inner-city neighbourhoods have been conceptualised, especially in North America, in both positivist and extant marxist work. I aim to rethink the processes generating 'gentrification' and 'gentrifiers' and our 'ways of seeing' the results of these processes. First, I address epistemological problems of neoclassical and marxist approaches to this subject. Second, I critically appraise the probl\'ematique of marxist work on gentrification, emphasising its lack of attention to the interrelationships of employment restructuring and changes in the reproduction of labour power. From this, I argue that gentrification is a 'chaotic concept' and that the processes and elements it comprises need to be thought through again. I begin this task by attempting to disaggregate the concept with empirical reference to North American metropolitan inner cities. I hypothesise that the upsurge of renovation activity by and for moderate-income households and those with so-called alternative life-styles is produced by the interaction of changes in production and reproduction. Further research is needed in this area. Finally, I explore the possibility that such 'marginal gentrifiers' and those they now displace may have similar needs that could be met by different kinds of neighbourhood revitalisation.},

In this article, we incorporate the ``systemic'' model of community life into debates on the U.S. crime drop, and we focus on the role that local nonprofit organizations played in the national decline of violence from the 1990s to the 2010s. Using longitudinal data and a strategy to account for the endogeneity of nonprofit formation, we estimate the causal effect on violent crime of nonprofits focused on reducing violence and building stronger communities. Drawing on a panel of 264 cities spanning more than 20 years, we estimate that every 10 additional organizations focusing on crime and community life in a city with 100,000 residents leads to a 9 percent reduction in the murder rate, a 6 percent reduction in the violent crime rate, and a 4 percent reduction in the property crime rate.},

However, this approach does not distinguish poor neighborhoods from segregated neighborhoods, ignores immigration and neglects city differences. Using Department of Commerce and 2000 Census data for zip codes in 331 MSA/PMSAs, we estimate HGLM models predicting the number of each of 10 organizational resources. We find that, (1) on average, as the poverty rate of a neighborhood increases, the number of establishments increases slightly; (2) as the proportion of blacks increases, the number of establishments decreases; (3) as the proportion of foreign-born increases, so does the number of establishments. Finally (4), metropolitan context matters: poor neighborhoods have more establishments in cities with low poverty rates, and in cities in the South and West, than in other parts of the country. Findings suggest reevaluating the de-institutionalized ghetto perspective as a theory of the effects of black segregation and depopulation, rather than poverty concentration, and approaching neighborhood poverty from a conditional perspective.},

Synthesising urban/regional development theory with comparative politics, this article examines a previously unconsidered contributing factor: the interaction of globalisation's rising inter-regional disparities with majoritarian electoral systems. Majoritarianism's distinct internal dynamics and imperfect representation mechanisms yield insufficient state responses to rising inter-regional inequality, stoking populist discontent. Global integration may thus be less stable today under majoritarian than proportional electoral rules. This has implications for urban/regional development scholarship, globalisation's durability and electoral reform.},

  abstract = {Industrial districts and regional clusters depend on the networks that arise from reciprocal linkages among co-located organizations, while physical proximity among firms can alter the nature of information and resource flows through networks. We consider the joint effects of geographic propinquity and network position on organizational innovation using negative binomial count models of patenting activity for U.S.-based life science firms in industrial districts and regional clusters across a 12-year time period, 1988\textendash 1999. We find evidence that regional agglomeration and network centrality exert complementary, but contingent, influences on organizational innovation. Results show that in the high-velocity, research-intensive field of biotechnology, geographic and network positions have both independent and contingent effects on organizational innovation. The influence of centrality in local, physically co-located partner networks depends on the extent to which firms are also embedded in a global network comprising physically distant partners. Such global centrality, however, alters how proximity to two important classes of organization-other biotechnology firms and public sector research organizations, such as universities, research institutes, and teaching hospitals\textemdash influences innovation. Regional agglomeration shapes the character of information and resource flows through networks, while much of what makes industrial clusters region-like involves the structure of their internal networks. We conclude that network effects persist both independently and interdependently with geographic variables, and regional characteristics influence the degree to which centrality enhances innovation.},
