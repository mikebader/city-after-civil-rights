# Overall Description
During the course of this semester, you will be diving deeply into a single community in the DC area. You will investigate its history, demographic characteristics, built environment (including housing), and its politics. 

The final project consists of a presentation of the community in a format of your choosing. For example, you may create a podcast describing, or a series of TikTok videos, an infographic, a webpage, or anything other medium. The only limitation on the format is that you must be able to share the final product on a website.

In the final project (in the medium of your choosing), you should do two things:

#. Describe the community as holistically as you can (more on that below), and
#. Explain how the structures that we discuss in class have helped to create the community and what agency was exerted to make them unique

# Interim Briefs

To guide your holistic description of the community, your group will submit four briefs during the semester. Each brief covers a different topic. You will find a description of the topics below as well as some *initial* guiding questions (you should not limit yourself to these). 

History.

: Investigate how the community came into being and identify the major periods of change that led to its existence in its current form. 

    Some questions to consider are: who occupied this land at different times? what changes in the city or metropolitan area did the community experience that led to the development (or hindered the development) of the community? was racial segregation enforced explicitly or implicitly in the community? has the name of the community changed, or is there even agreement now?

Demographic Characteristics.

: Describe the composition of the neighborhood's residents and, if possible, how that has changed over time. 

    Some questions to consider are: what is the racial composition of the community? how does the racial composition vary by different ages? what share of residents were born in another country? what share of residents own their own homes? what share have different types of degrees? what is the median income in the community? how do homeownership rates, the median income, and educational attainment differ across demographic groups? in what types of industries are residents employed?

Built Environment & Housing.

: Describe what has been built in the community and the types of housing exist in the area. 

    Some questions to consider are: what is the mix of apartments and single family homes? Are businesses near residential areas or do they require driving? does the density of people or housing vary across the community? what are the zoning requirements in the neighborhood? what share of people live in multifamily homes versus single-family homes? 

Politics.

: Explain the main political questions confronting the community. 

    Some questions to consider are: what political body (or bodies) represent this community: city/county councils, mayor/executive, school boards, etc.? Does the racial composition of elected representatives match the demographic makeup of the community? What were important topics in the last election for those offices? How much did candidates spend on their campaigns? 

I hope to help you get a sense of your community by submitting these briefs. As such, I will provide feedback on the briefs that you should use to improve your analysis. I may even ask you to resubmit your brief after revising it. The briefs should be written but may also contain material in the medium that you plan to use for your final project. 

Your group may choose which order in which you submit the topics for the briefs. You should submit one brief on each of the dates below:

* \duedateone
* \duedatetwo
* \duedatethree
* \duedatefour

# Final Project

Your final project should include all four aspects of the community that you will brief above. But you should be creative about how you combine them and present them. Think about the different ways that you can communicate the information. For example, think about how Ta-Nehisi Coates weaves in history and demographics around the narrative of Clyde Ross' life or how Chana Joffe-Walt in the *Nice White Parents* podcast uses the voices of parents and students to explain the politics inside schools.

You should strive to engage your audience with your project. Your goal should be to develop something that people can consume and then discuss with friends, neighbors, family. In addition, you should situate how this community has been shaped by the structures and forces that we study in our readings throughout class. This will require that you accentuate some aspects of the community and focus on others less. Doing so requires sound editorial judgements. Think about who and what you will leave out and be intentional about those decisions. 

Your final project should follow the conventions of the medium you are using. For example, written material should be proofread and edited for clarity, videos should not include distracting jump cuts or audio problems, visual presentations should be aligned and justified. 

Your final project will be graded on the following:

* Completion and revision (if necessary) of topic briefs (10% each)
* Creativity of the final project and how compellingly you present the material (25%)
* Explanation regarding how structures and agency have shaped this community and made it unique (25%)
* Neatness and following conventions of the medium (10%)
