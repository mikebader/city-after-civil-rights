You should gather Census data for your community. But you may find that what you consider your "community" may not have a single or standard definition. How you define you community for your research will determine how you collect data from the Census. 

## Defining Your Community

In order to know the *geography* that represents your community in the Census, you will first need to figure out what defines your community. You should consider different definitions or even different names for your community. Several places that you can explore to get a sense of your community:

* Google Maps & Open Street Map
* Wikipedia
* Local media (e.g., blogs, Twitter accounts, local papers)
* Regional media (e.g., *Washington Post*, TV and radio news affiliates)
* People who live, work, or travel there
* Census bureau (Census Designated Places---more below)

It's possible, and even likely, that you may end up finding disagreements about the definitions of neighborhoods. You should consider the methods and reasons different sources will use to define communities in certain ways. Those may be related to the very processes that you want to uncover (for example, it's possible that one definition of a community excludes areas where different racial groups or socioeconomic statuses are present). 

You should explain how you come to the conclusion that you do about the definition of place. 

## Identifying Data Sources

Once you've defined your community, you will need to identify data that you can use to describe your community. At a minimum, I want you to describe the racial/ethnic composition of your community, the socioeconomic status of your community, and the age composition. It may be particularly helpful to look at the intersection of these categories (for example, age composition by race). All of these data will come from the Census. 

You should also consider other data sources that may describe important aspects of your community. You may want to know about the number or type of businesses present or the type of zoning. Those will require other data sources and will depend on the topic that you want to cover. Let me know what interests you, and we can discuss what data might be available for you to use. 

## Obtaining Census Data

Census data are available for different *geographies* and in different *data sources*. To obtain the data that you want, you need to identify the geography before you start and then you need to choose among the data sources available at that geography. 

#### Census geography. 

The Census reports statistics for dozens of different geographic units. They range in size from the nation on the large end to the block at the small end. The type of data available depends on the geography. Small geographies tend to have fewer statistics than large geographies in order to protect the privacy of residents. For this project, you will likely use one of two different geographies to define your community: tracts or places (including Census Designated Places [CDPs]).

Census tracts

: are the closest approximation to "neighborhoods" (in the colloquial sense of the word) that the Census publishes. Census tracts contain, on average, about 4,000 residents (nationwide) and generally range from 1,000 to 8,000 residents. Your community may be entirely within a single tract, or it may extend to all or parts of multiple census tracts. This will be something that you should discuss with your group and then meet with me to figure out how best to draw the boundaries. 

Places and Census Designated Places (CDPs)

: represent the equivalent of towns or cities: *places* are actual municipal entities smaller than counties (or that cross county boundaries) while *Census designated places* are areas that are not part of a municipality smaller than a county, but are not officially municipalities. You will be more likely to need to use these geographic units if you are studying a suburban community.

    The designation is even more confusing because Virginia has a number of what are called "independent cities" that are treated by the commonwealth as the equivalent of counties (Maryland also has the same designation but only one city fits the definition: Baltimore city). If define your community as one of these entities, you will find the data in the *county* dataset.

You may also want to consider other geographic units as comparisons to your community. For example, if you are studying a neighborhood in DC, you may want to compare your community's demographic profile to that of the entire city (available as a "state," because, you know, nothing can be easy) or to the ward it is in (available as the "State Legislative District -- Upper Chamber"). 

#### Census data. 

The Census now collects data in two separate programs: the decennial census and the American Community Survey.
